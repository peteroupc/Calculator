This package contains two demo programs:

* A calculator for .NET intended to demonstrate two things about the CBOR
library:
    * First, this program shows how CBOR can serve as a data format for storing application configuration data.
      Here, this program saves the last position of the window when it exits into a CBOR
      configuration file.
    * Second, this program uses the arbitrary-precision arithmetic capabilities of the
       CBOR library in its calculations.
* A converter from JSON to CBOR and back, intended to demonstrate the CBOR
and JSON features of the CBOR library.

**[Learn more about the Calculator program](https://peteroupc.github.io/Calculator/AboutTheCode.html).**

To compile this package, you first need to install the package "PeterO.Cbor" from the NuGet repository.
